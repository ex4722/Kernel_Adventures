When calling mmap use 0x1000 NOT 0x100 and page aligned for addd

Creating userfault fd needs valid addrs

Seems like fautl handler on cares about pages, once handled once don't happen again?? needs to move onto next 0x100 page

First , kfree shm_file_data . After that, perform POP and allocate the slab object used as shm_file_data as an Element structure. After setting pid etc., copy_to_user is performed, but a fault is generated here and processing is transferred to the handler. By doing a PUSH inside it, the pid is properly set, but the data corresponding to Element.value remains a pointer in the previous shm_file_data , which can be leaked. 

No verbose mode lead to 
Unexpected event on userfaultfd
[+] Fault at 0x0 caught


Leak:
Mall + Free object with leaks 
Push onto ur uffd addr 
Copies PID and ownwer but 0x16 not overwritten
Handle fault and pop 
    Pid and ownwer are correct but  value == og objets 

Release


AAW AAR:
Double Free -> Push -> Universal Heap Spray to Overwrite Element pointer??

Can't complile save crap without -no-pie
